# Definitions

In this file we define an operation `D` (differentiation)
on formal power series in one variable (over an arbitrary commutative semi-ring).

We prove the product rule and the chain rule for differentiation of formal power series.

Under suitable assumptions, we prove that two power series are equal if their derivatives
are equal and their constant terms are equal. This gives us a simple tool for proving
power series identities. For example, one can easily prove the power series identity
`exp ( log (1+X)) = 1+X` by differentiating twice. Several examples of this kind of
identity are contained in the accomanying file "Examples.lean".


## Main results

- `PowerSeries.D_mul`  : the product rule (Leibniz' rule) for differentiating.
- `PowerSeries.D_comp` : the chain rule for differentiating power series.

## Notation

- `PowerSeries.D R`     : the formal derivative `R⟦X⟧ → R⟦X⟧`
